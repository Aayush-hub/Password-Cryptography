In today's world internet is the new fuel and most important for an individual in this world is privacy. So, to keep your data safe you require a strong password which can not be guessed. This script helps you to generate, encrypt and decrypt passwords. This script generates password from 52 alphabetic characters (uppercase and lowercase), 10 digits, and 16 special symbols and encrpyts it on the go with asking a access key from user and setting it. With the encryted password it would take 28 Billion years for anyone having no access key to crack it. But I have made it easy for user who want to distribute their data in secure way as this repo also contains decrypter, from which you can easliy decrypt your passwords after entering access key. By this way you can easily distribute data giving access key to trusted person and decrypter script. This project is in development phase and more features are to be added soon.
